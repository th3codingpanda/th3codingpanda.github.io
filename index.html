      <h3>
        My name is Raf Woud, and I'm 19 years old. I'm studying software/game development at the ROC van Flevoland. I have a passion for creating things and find it very interesting to learn how programs work in the background.
    <br><br>
    I excel at back-end programming, so I find it important that my code is as readable as possible. I like to make things as complex as possible, but always on time.
    People say I'm determined, eager to learn, and sociable in this regard.
    <br><br>
    I'd like to learn more coding languages ​​to build as much coding knowledge as possible. During my internship, I hope to improve my teamwork by learning more best practices. In the future, I'd like to share my passion for coding with others.

            <h1>Yahtzee</h1>
            <p>This was my first JavaScript project, and I decided to go all out by making our Yahtzee game support as many players as possible. I chose to use arrays to store the players' scores, which helped me learn how arrays work. It also allowed me to think more rationally about how to plan out the project I had in mind. </p>                <h3>CodingLanguage:</h3>

            <h1>2DGame</h1>
            <p>For my first Unity project, a 2D platformer, I chose a Celeste-like style, with a camera that is locked to a room until you move to another one. Additionally, I added a dash mechanic and created a function that allows you to reverse gravity. It was very educational to work in Unity for the first time, and I learned a lot from it.</p>

            <h1>Admin Program</h1>
            <p>This was one of my favorite projects to work on. I was challenged by my teacher to make my admin project securely save files in a JSON file with encryption. To achieve this, I used SHA-256 to encrypt the password when an account is created, storing the encrypted password in the JSON file. Upon login, the entered password is converted to SHA-256 and compared to the JSON file password. <br><br>I also added the ability for users to change their own passwords, and users can also delete their own accounts, which removes the corresponding entry from the JSON file. Admins, on the other hand, have the ability to change both the password and the admin status of other users, as well as delete other users' accounts. Overall, it was a ton of fun learning these new concepts and implementing them.</p>

            <h1>3D TowerDefence</h1>
            <p>This was a two-person team project. We decided to create a customizable Tower Defense layout for our game. I personally worked on the enemy pathfinding script. Since the layout is dynamic, I chose to implement A* (A-star Pathfinding). The algorithm assigns a cost to each cell and then finds the cheapest path to the endpoint. I also worked on the movement, tower placement, and wall placement scripts, as well as the cost handler for those features.</p>
